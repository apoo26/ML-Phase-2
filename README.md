# ML-Phase-2
# Implementation phase
The source code[1] needs to be run as follows:

"python MLImplementation.py (training file name) (testing file name) (no. of example samples) (sampling rate) (no. of candidate classes)"

where,
1. no. of example samples are the no. of samples to be chosen per class
2. sampling rate is the rate of choosing the classes to sample
3. no. of candidate classes are the classes for prediction

We have analysed the results (acccuracies achieved) obtained by plotting a graph between accuracy and number of candidate classes considered. Code for the same has been attached (Graphs.py).
We have also considered additional evaluation parameters like F1 Score, Logarithmic loss,mean absolute error. Code for the same has also been added to the MLImplementation.py file.
