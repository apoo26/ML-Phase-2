# ML-Phase-2
# Implementation phase
The source code[1] needs to be run as follows:

"python MLImplementation.py (training file name) (testing file name) (no. of example samples) (sampling rate) (no. of candidate classes)"

where,
no. of example samples are the no. of samples to be chosen per class
sampling rate is the rate of choosing the classes to sample
no. of candidate classes are the classes for prediction
